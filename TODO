    electrical:
        rework board outline to get cuts within spec and tabs to mechanically
        stable, not to mention get the kicad 3D renderer to eat it
        
        need to seperate the demo keyboard from the 
        controller.
        
        need to get the spice simulation up and running.
        
        prove demo board will perform similarly to spice model (may require 
        actually implementing hardware and testing it with a signal gen and 
        o-scope)

    mechanical:
        begin design of beam spring mechanism for switch.
